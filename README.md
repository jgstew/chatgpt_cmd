ChatGPT> write a poem about using chatgpt on the command line
Using ChatGPT on the command line,
Is a marvel of modern time,
With questions asked and answers found,
The exchange of knowledge does astound.
Type away, and see what comes,
From this digital oracle, never once glum,
A source of wisdom, always on hand,
A guide to help you understand.

Though not as fancy as its GUI kin,
Using ChatGPT on the command line is no sin,
No flashy colors or designs to see,
But it gets the job done perfectly.

So ask away, and have no fear,
ChatGPT on the command line is near,
With answers quick and knowledge sound,
Thereâ€™s no limit to what we can be found.
ChatGPT> exit
Exiting ChatGPT_CMD...
```
